Shopping List implementation with functions and prewritten tests.

## Assignment

You are to implement a Shopping List in javascript. In particular, your implementation will retain the ability to:

* create a `list item`
* add said `list item` to list
* remove an item from list
* compute sum of prices

## How to Implement

For each function that must be implemented, there is a corresponding test that should pass upon successful implementation of function. Once all the tests are passing, this assignment is complete.

**NOTE**: the tests are relatively "dumb" so edge cases aside from the obvious ones are not accounted for. As an additional challenge, consider writing tests for all the edge cases and implementing the function to pass these assertions.

## How to get started

1. **FORK** (top right button underneath the profile dropdown) this repo.
2. **Download** (or clone) this repo to your local environment. 
3. **Implement** your functions and assert tests pass.
4. **Make** a PR against this base project to "submit". (Consider **[this](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)** resource for further information)
