// 1. create a function that alerts "hello, wrold"
// you may choose to name it whatever you like

//helloWroldFromTaqquisComputer();

// 2. open up the page in browser - do you see the alert?
// if not, debug and figure out why the alert isn't showing

// 3. create a function that takes in two variables and sums them
// output the solution in console

// 4. create a function, addNSums, that can take in as many
// arguments as possible (think about how you would pull this off)
// write some logic that adds up all the arguments and spits that out
// to console

// 5. write a function, generateRandNums, that takes ONE integer as the 
// argument - lets call it numberToGenerate - and creates an array with 
// numberToGenerate elements. This function will need to return something
// which we haven't really covered yet, so just have your function follow 
// the format below

// sample calling of generateRandNums
// it passes in 10 to the function argument and 
// saves the output - the 'return'ed value into a
// variable called myArrayOfRandomNumbers

// 6. create a new function, addNSumsWithCHeck, that does the same thing
// addNSums does. BUT: figure out a way to check the number of arguments 
// that are being passed in and if that length is > 50
// console out "TOO MANY ARGS" otherwise print out the sum

// 7. write a simple click event - just create a DIV in the html
// that, when clicked, will perform an action
// however, instead of just passing in the function as an argument to click()
/*
*** EXAMPLE OF HOW WE USUALLY DO CLICK EVENTS
$('div').click( function() {
	alert('hello!')
});
*/
// implement this so that you pass in the name of the function that you want called after click has occurred
