# JavaScript Bootcamp 
üéâüéàüéÇüçæüéäüçªüíÉ


*A hands on and practical introduction
 to programming and javascript development.*
 
 JavaScript (js) is one heck of a language. Initially developed over the course of a weekend, it is now one of the most popular programming languages used all over the world. Initially, JavaScript was developed to run in the web browser. Every single website that has ever existed leveraged js to power all dynamic features (colloquially referred to as the ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù). In the past decade, the language has been ported over to run server-side (or, colloquially speaking, on the ‚Äúbackend‚Äù). This was a turning point for the language since it made js the only language needed to build a fully functional, end to end website. These days, javascript is used to build everything: from website front- and back-ends to desktop apps to even IoT (internet of things) hardware based projects. In this course, we will explore all aspects of this language in our quest to master both programming and in particular, practical web development.

This body of text is a living document. It will be updated with course and lecture content as supplied by General Assembly and any custom course material (developed on an as needed basis by lecturer). It is also intended to be the source of truth for all lectures delivered by the course instructors. Keep this document bookmarked and be sure to visit it often for reference.
